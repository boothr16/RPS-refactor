# RPS-refactor
This purpose of this project is to refactor the previously completed RPS game. In the first iteration (RPS-Javascript), the RPS game was played entirely through the console, text prompts, and alerts. The code will be refactored in this project, so that the game can be played via a simple GUI powered by Javascript.
